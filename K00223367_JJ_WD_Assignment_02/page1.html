                <h1>Writing</h1>
                <p>What is it that makes me write, what is it about writing that makes us want to avoid pain and strife. Go for the page strike the note.
                I am born to write, I believe that more than ever. The power of words, the power to change the lives of others, make them think inward and see what beauty they have in their hearts.
                Each writer is different but each writer shows bits of themselves, a bit of their character, a bit of their soul because in order to be listened to, you must speak from the heart, a lot of writers are quite introverted and tend to hide away but when they come to the page and don't hold back, we see into their hearts, get a sample of who they're and sometimes identify with them, sometimes we feel as if we're being directly talked to. There so many stories out there, whether fiction or non-fiction which have a narrative of the world, the heartbeat of the human race is in stories I believe even in history, in facts, the way they're portrayed to us, tell a story of the past. The way the news is fed to us, the way we interpret events may be different to the next person, we all have some kind of connection with certain news, certain stories spun to us, we know in these times that we're equal as we feel empathy and compassion but sometimes we're disillusioned with it all, dis-enfranchised to it all, our brains switch off but our hearts never do.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p>I believe there aren't a lot of good writers around these days, not ones that I know of who stand out, maybe I haven't looked hard enough or maybe they have yet to come. There are a minority who speak the truth, who are not afraid to speak out, to speak of what is in their hearts, instead we get "Fifty Shades of Grey" and I'm sorry to those who like the books but what good are these books doing but glamorising, capitalism, greed, infatuation, violence and heightened sexual fantasies but then maybe I don't know enough about that.
                Writing has been around a long time from the first writing on the walls of caves to the modern kindle which I'm not a fan of. Far too much writing on the digital space nowadays but I still love a good book. So many books you can read on this and that, you can be an expert on nearly everything nowadays without even going to university, you can learn so much online, people offering the entrepeneur lifestyle and what not. They're people blogging, vlogging, setting up websites, writing content, copyrighting, playwrighting, screenwriting, writing poetry, prose and so on and so forth. There is so much competition but then you're your own competition. In order to be a professional writer, you must write everyday, you must discipline yourself like any craft to learn what to do and what not to do, then break the rules. English is a new language among all the languages of the world so it's still evolving, changing with the times as it is used, not always used well, sometimes used to manipulate and deceive people especially in marketing and Black Friday is just one of the many ways, business, especially big business manipulate the masses into thinking we're getting a bargain on shit we don't need.
                Advertising has become very clever in the way it manipulates the mainstream into thinking they're getting the best deal, often selling a lifestyle to us, some of us have become shopaholics, slaves to corporate greed. Slogans, advertising jargon, like fat free, low fat, natural, 100% this or that, it's all spin to make us feel good for buying something but do a little research and you'll find that not everything that you buy that you think is good for you,is.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The most interesting form of writing nowadays and is a growing trend, is blogging, well it's been growing for a while but it is a great avenue for people to get their point across or advertise their product, there are more avenues for writing nowadays that there ever was, a more diverse range of writing, a saturated market ya might say. How would Shakespeare of kept up with all of it or would he of been bigger than he ever was, although he is bigger than he ever was now and has a huge influence over other writing so he's more well off now dead than he was alive. Then writing was seen as a craft, not something other to us,but something similar to carpentry or any other trade. It was not something that could be worked on and the more time you spent at it, the better you would get. It was not seen as a gift, he was just another trade. I think that's where we go wrong with creativity, we tend to see it something other to ourselves, not something we can share and hone but a past-time. There are so many writers out there not known, hiding because they're afraid of sharing their craft as others would tear them down.
                <br>    
                <p>I believe it is because of fame and fortune that writing in a professional capacity is alien to those who write but never divulge their writing to a publisher or the world. That they don't believe that it is possible to get there, maybe they only see the money side of it, they concentrate on trying to please themselves while not being true to themselves but then there may be writers who write to a certain demographic then there are those who can do both, can keep writing the stories and the characters that people want to see and then work on something that really means something to them.

                <br>
                
                <p>True writing comes form within, not dictated by some agenda, not writing to a certain demographic but writing what is important to our understanding of each other, our understanding of ourselves, the most powerful writing, is the writing that makes you feel something, makes you feel connected, hold a mirror up to the human race, show us a part of us, show us that we're all equal whether bad or good. This is the writing that needs to be wrote over and over again till we see we're one and the same, till we see through all the bullshit and see reality as it's supposed to be and a unrealistic world at which we are being spun by some writing in the way some media spins reality or reality television or even the news. Only we know what is real, only we create reality and only good writing replicates that reality. </p>
